Introduction:  
This research paper discusses the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in business and industry, referencing publications from the International Journal of Information Management. The study identifies challenges related to AI’s application for decision-making within the context of big data. It aims to provide theoretical advancements and insight into AI implementation, highlighting that prior research tends to focus narrowly on specific fields such as Business Intelligence & Analytics (BI&A) or decision support systems. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a broader, more comprehensive overview of AI's impact across various business sectors.
